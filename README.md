# K-Means-and-Silhoutte-Score

This is an ongoing project where I am to learning and implementing K-means clustering algorithm
I have also explored the concept of "Elbow Method"

Note: This project does not include any EDA or preprocessing since this repo is strictly used to implement the algorithm 

The Next Steps:
I would be exploring the concept of silhouette score to find the right K value when the elbow method fails to provide a definitive evaluation
